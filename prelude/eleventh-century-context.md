* play a minigame on the _Pataria_ (Patarine) movement in Milan. This should really be viewed as an in-game tutorial of sorts. It allows students to spend a day getting acquainted with the mechanics and issues of the game and getting comfortable with role playing and public speaking. Each playerâ€™s character sheet will contains a short addendum describing their Milanese alter-ego. The session is centered around the issues of **papal supremacy over secular rulers** and the **validity of lay investiture**. For this session, players should be sure to carefully read at least Dictatus papae from the primary sources section of the game book. For this session the GM will act as the moderator of the debates, taking on the persona of the truffle-forager from the opening vignette of the game book.
