# Eleventh-Century Context

### Goals (September 19th and 21st)

This week will conclude our rapid introduction to the prehistory of the Investiture Controversy and introduce students to Reacting to the Past game play. We will:&#x20;

* learn about the immediate historical background for the _Pataria_ minigame that we will play on Wednesday. Students will read a primary source that conveys the events but also how historical actors spoke, as a necessary starting point for gameplay
* the professor will distribute character sheets for the game (September 20th)
* on Monday we will give you a sense of what to expect in the game and Wednesday's session should be understood as a "soft opening" – a chance to practice speaking and getting into character before the main game narrative opens...
* submit your written [profile](../syllabus/coursework/writing/profile.md) on September 23rd, 4pm.&#x20;

### Overview

* learn about the political, social and religious conflict of the mid and late eleventh century
* play a minigame on the _Pataria_ (Patarine) movement in Milan. This should really be viewed as an in-game tutorial of sorts. It allows students to spend a day getting acquainted with the mechanics and issues of the game and getting comfortable with role playing and public speaking. Each player’s character sheet will contains a short addendum describing their Milanese alter-ego.&#x20;
  * The session is centered around the issues of **papal supremacy over secular rulers** and the **validity of lay investiture**. For this session, players should be sure to carefully read at least Dictatus papae from the primary sources section of the game book. For this session the GM will act as the moderator of the debates, taking on the persona of the truffle-forager from the opening vignette of the game book.

### Read/Watch/Listen

Before Wednesday's class, read [Andrea di Sturmo's _Passion of Arialdo_](https://app.perusall.com/courses/medieval-religious-life-2022/the-pataria-andrea-da-strumi-s-passion-of-arialdo-late-eleventh-century?assignmentId=x6y8QppBgLW6kA25H\&part=1) describing the end of the Patarine movement in Milan. This account is a hagiographic work, which means the author is writing (_graphos_) in order to argue that the subject is a saint (_hagios_). Your goal is to pick up how the author is writing as a way to think about how you might speak and argue in the opening gameplay/ debate on Wednesday.

If you really want to get a sense of how to understand the text/ these events, read the optional article by [Piroska Nagy](https://app.perusall.com/courses/medieval-religious-life-2022/piroska-nagy-collective-emotions-history-writing-and-change-the-case-of-the-pataria-milan-eleventh-century?assignmentId=6BKvxQ6Tzr4HZnELp\&part=1) looking at how the text (and speakers in the moment) used emotion to harness support and provoke a reaction (and ultimately spark violence). there&#x20;

### Practice

On September 21st, we will play the _Pataria_ minigame, which simulates the religious foment happening in Italian urban communities in the eleventh century. Whichever faction wins the debate/ game gains a minor advantage in future sessions.&#x20;
