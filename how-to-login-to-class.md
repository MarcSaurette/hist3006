# How to join class

Our classes are scheduled take place on Mondays and Wednesdays from 10h00 until 11h30. &#x20;

&#x20;It is important that you get [Teams](digital-tools/ms-teams/) and [Perusall](digital-tools/perusall.md) working as soon as you can. Perusall is easy to get working. Teams, if you haven't used it before at Carleton, may not be. So please try to login before class starts in the Fall.&#x20;

We will meet in person for our first class on September 7th, 2022. See the [schedule here](weekly-schedule/).&#x20;

Having helped students and colleagues try to use Teams for the last two years, I know that it can be either easy to login or quite frustrating. The ratio seems to be about 80/20 (i.e. for the majority it is easy). But please do not leave it to the last minute to try to get it running!

1. Figure out your Carleton email, either by activating it for the first time or ensuring that you are able to use it. See [here for instructions](https://carleton.ca/its/all-services/email/carleton-student-email/).&#x20;
2. [Install Teams](digital-tools/ms-teams/) on your computer and set it up. If at all possible don't use the browser version.
3. Make sure you are part of the "Medieval Religions Life" Team.&#x20;
4. If our Team doesn't pop up as an option in your Teams dashboard, click on the "Join or Create a Team" button and enter the code: **3d42n0e.** This will only work if you are correctly logged in with your Carleton account.&#x20;
5. Find the general channel and text "hello" to tell us you're successfully logged in.&#x20;
