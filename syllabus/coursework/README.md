# Coursework

When learning in person, professors and students meet in class for lectures and to discuss readings, debate etc. Thus, some learning happens together at the same time, and some other learning happens on the student's own time (e.g. writing papers, doing readings etc.). When a course is online, this is also the case. We will have some time together (on [MS Teams](https://marc-saurette.gitbook.io/the-making-of-the-middle-ages/course-info/digital-tools/teams)), and sometimes learning happens "asynchronously" (i.e. on our own time).

Usually when I teach this course, I divide work into oral and written work. Oral work usually consists of "participation" i.e. being in class, asking questions, showing you've learned from doing the readings, etc (an abbreviation of _et cetera_, Latin for "and other things"). But participation, since we're taking this online, will be based on "conversations"/ discussions in the [Teams](https://marc-saurette.gitbook.io/the-making-of-the-middle-ages/course-info/digital-tools/teams) platform – it might be oral or it might be written. Over the course of the first term, you will complete the following work – designed so that you build on skills you will have acquired earlier in the year.

So, let's get this out in the open. Participation is always difficult to assess. Even in face-to-face classes, I can measure what I see, but I don't know the work that has been done behind the scenes (especially if you are a quiet or shy student). So typically, I have had students assign themselves a mark for participation each class – based on a rubric assigning points for attendence and for degree of participation.

For online lectures, I will take attendence through Teams and, at the end of the week, will request that you assign yourself a mark of 5 for the quality of your participation. At the end of the term, you will write up a process letter explaining the quality of your participation, part of which will be to assess your contributions to class discussion.

The key to academic success is practice – especially practicing writing. Writing is hard for everyone, especially when a genre is unfamiliar or the expectations are unclear. I'll try to make the expectations clear and over time the expected norms of writing will become familiar to you.

A "[process letter](process-letters.md)" is a term we use to describe an end-of-term self-evaluation of your own work. You will write this up as a way to justify the grade you will assign to yourself for first term, based on guided questions I will provide. Some of your work will be done in groups, so part of your letter will be the pleasant job of acknowledging those who did an exceptional job and the more difficult one of calling out those who were less atisfactory.

In the second term, the class will work on a group project that we will work on each week in order to develop a new historically- inspired game.

## **Each week you will:**  <a href="#each-week-you-will" id="each-week-you-will"></a>

* prepare for class by completing the assigned readings and making annotations on the texts (primary sources, secondary sources, images, websites) mostly posted on [Perusall](https://marc-saurette.gitbook.io/the-making-of-the-middle-ages/course-info/digital-tools/perusall).
* attend a synchronous online seminars via [Teams](https://marc-saurette.gitbook.io/the-making-of-the-middle-ages/course-info/digital-tools/teams), where I will lead a discussion about weekly topics, answer questions
* complete weekly exercises intended to practice foundational skills of History/ Medieval Studies
* write a weekly reflection in your cuPortfolio to practice writing
* go on optional "Quests" to discover helpful study skills or resources at Carleton
* work to decipher the mysterious happenings at "The Academy" in groups
