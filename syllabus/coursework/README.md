# Coursework\*

Usually when I teach this course, I divide work into oral and written work. Oral work usually consists of "participation" i.e. being in class, asking questions, showing you've learned from doing the readings, etc (an abbreviation of _et cetera_, Latin for "and other things"). So, let's get this out in the open. Participation is always difficult to assess. I can measure what I see, but I don't know the work that has been done behind the scenes (especially if you are a quiet or shy student). So typically, I have had students assign themselves a mark for participation each class – based on a rubric assigning points for attendence and for degree of participation.

**I will take attendance** and, at the end of the term, you will write up a process letter explaining the quality of your participation, part of which will be to assess your contributions to class discussion.

The key to academic success is practice – especially practicing writing. Writing is hard for everyone, especially when a genre is unfamiliar or the expectations are unclear. I'll try to make the expectations clear and over time the expected norms of writing will become familiar to you.

A "[process letter](process-letters.md)" is a term we use to describe an end-of-term self-evaluation of your own work. You will write this up as a way to justify the grade you will assign to yourself for first term, based on guided questions I will provide. Some of your work will be done in groups, so part of your letter will be the pleasant job of acknowledging those who did an exceptional job and the more difficult one of calling out those who were less atisfactory.

* prepare for class by completing the assigned readings and making annotations on the texts (primary sources, secondary sources, images, websites) mostly posted on [Perusall](https://marc-saurette.gitbook.io/the-making-of-the-middle-ages/course-info/digital-tools/perusall).
* attend class, meet with your group members and plan strategy
