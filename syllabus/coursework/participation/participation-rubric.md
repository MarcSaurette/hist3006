# Participation Rubric\*

You will be asked to evaluate your own participation for this class. The following is a rough guide for thinking about our expectations:

**A range:**  Attended all of the time.  Participated frequently.  Participation almost always addressed pertinent issues, and demonstrated a clear understanding of the dynamics of the game.  Participation frequently or always integrated readings into the arguments made by the character, demonstrated a clear sense of the student’s “character” and the way that character would have reacted to game events.  In general, convincingly demonstrated thorough understanding of the game and the readings. &#x20;

**B range:** Attended most or all of the time.  Participated frequently.  Participation usually addressed pertinent issues regarding the game.  Readings not always integrated into the arguments made during the games, or didn’t always demonstrate complete understandings of the readings. &#x20;

**C range:**  Attended most or all of the time.  Participated reasonably often, but participation indicated lack of complete understanding of the game and seldom cited readings OR participated occasionally, but in ways that demonstrated clear understanding of the course of the game and used the ideas of the readings successfully in addressing game issues.

**D range:**  Attended most of the time, but seldom participated.  Participation indicated little understanding of the game or of the readings upon which the game was based.

**F**:  Rarely attended, said little, openly ignored game or game requirements.
