# Participation\*

Participation is very important for this class since one of our main learning objectives is to improve students’ ability to verbalize their thoughts and assesments, as well as logically discuss/ debate. Nothing can be evidence unless it is placed in a logical argument, and class is meant to let you practice this faculty.

For the first part of the course, participation will be significant during the [Investiture Controversy gameplay](../../../investiture-controversy-game/). Students will be expected to speak in class to deliver speeches, argue with their opponents, craft persuasive letters, write panegyric verse, plot (via DMs on Teams), or meet up to discuss strategy as a faction (in small groups online). I will be able to assess what happens during our synchronous sessions - but a great deal of your participation might happen behind closed doors - so you will be in charge of assessing your own participation. The three faction leaders will preside over the three councils (which means their level of verbal participation will be slightly greater at baseline).&#x20;

During the first part of the course (weeks 1-7), we will be taking attendence during the synchronous portions. This information will be used to evaluate your self-assessment of first part of the course.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

At minimum, students are expected to log in to synchronous having done reading and thought through necessary question and answers, and be willing to talk about them (and by talk I mean out loud and via text chats). Students are expected to engage during the course to identify key themes and issues, evaluate the authors’ positions/reasoning/logic, ask and answer questions from classmates and the professor, etc.

* Normally, this takes place in person – during class lectures and small group discussions, and through one-on-one interaction with the professor and TA (office hours, conversations before/after class).
* Clearly – the distance-learning nature of this term will make all that a little different. I suspect that we will experiment with a number of different methods of trying to elicit student engagement during class before landing on those that work the best for us

## Be Prepared <a href="#be-prepared" id="be-prepared"></a>

The most important part of participation is being prepared. You might be willing to contribute and be able to speak persuasively, but this does not contribute if you have not read and thought about the materials assigned for each class. You are asked to make annotations on the readings of the textbook each week. This will be an important part of your participation. You'll be asked to write a minimum of seven (7) annotations each week on your [Readings](../readings.md).

## How to Participate <a href="#how-to-participate" id="how-to-participate"></a>

Our plan is to give students a wide variety of opportunities to actively participate in the course. In fact, students may actually have more ways to show participation in this online model. Students will be able to actively participate through the following :

* Annotation and commenting on Perusall.
  *   Students are asked to read, comment on and reflect on the textbook readings (and additional assigned/optional texts) via Perusall.

      ​
*   Q+A periods during lectures

    * Students will be encouraged to add questions/comments throughout lectures; during mid-lecture Q+A periods, the profs and TA’s will pick several questions/comments to discuss further/respond to

    ​
*   Participation in online gameplay

    * speaking, debating etc. as discussed above


*   Chat commentary during class

    * Students will be able to engage each other and the TA’s in real-time discussion throughout the lecture using the chat function)

    ​
*   Small group breakout sessions during class

    * At some point during classes, students will be broken up into small breakout groups (for factions) to discuss a particular question/theme, after which groups will be invited to report back to the full class.


* Discussions with TA/prof during office hours

## General principles of evaluation:  <a href="#general-principles-of-evaluation" id="general-principles-of-evaluation"></a>

Given the variety of factors that might impact a given student’s ability to participate fully and consistently through any one of these methods (and to ensure that the professor can be as flexible as possible accommodating students’ specific situations), participation will be understood holistically. That is to say, participation is viewed as the sum total of a student’s participation through all of the above (and other) methods – meaning that it is possible for students to successfully satisfy their participation mark without engaging in all types of participation every week. While I will keep track of my assessments of your participation, you ultimately are responsible for assessing your participation.

In general, here are some examples of the type of questions students will be asked to think about in evaluating their participation:

* Were they present during synchronous parts of the course?
* Did the student remain strongly focused during the class and did s/he/they seek to actively listen/process/integrate the ideas during class discussions?
* Did the student participate in class discussion (e.g. through live questions/comments; through the chat/whiteboard functions)?
* Did the student demonstrate significant and insightful knowledge regarding class material (has s/he been able to consistently answer questions about the readings in class, pose thoughtful questions in/outside of class, demonstrated that s/he/they has attempted to connect the themes/ideas of class to the contemporary world, etc)?
* Did the student enhance the learning environment by participating respectfully in discussions with her/his colleagues?

While you will be asked to self-evaluate your participation, your instructors and teaching assistant will keep track of their subjective evaluation of your work.

* First, in each class, the professor will track and record attendance and observable forms of participation– including live questions/comments; whiteboard comments/questions; content engagement on the chat board; discussions in breakout groups; etc.
* Second, at the end of each week, you will be asked given a link to a MS Form and fill out a weekly work sheet, providing links to work completed and describing your work each week.

&#x20;If the professor assesses that a student has consistently (i.e. in every class) participated at an exceptional level throughout the term, the professors may decide to reward bonus marks, above what the student has self-assessed.
