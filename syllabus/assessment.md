# Assessment\*

We will be using a simplified form of assessment for this class. All work will be assessed as either Unsatisfactory, Satisfactory or Excellent. If all your work is assessed as **Satisfactory**, you will receive a B. If all your work is assessed as **Excellent**, you will receive an A+. If you receive a mixture of these two, your grade will fall somewhere in the middle. Work deemed unsatisfactory can be reworked and submitted for reassessment.

| Assignment                | Percentage of Grade |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Readings and annotations  | 20%                 |
| Participation             | 25%                 |
| Profile                   |                     |
| Game Texts/ Speeches      | 20%                 |
| Game Design Contributions | 20%                 |
| Process Letters           | 2X 5% (Pass/Fail)   |

In addition to marks assessed for written work and verbal presentations, I also will take into account your overall self-assessment. [Participation](coursework/participation/) will be entirely self-assessed (though your maximum grade is determined partly by attendance).

This course will focus on qualitative not quantitative assessment, something we’ll discuss during the class. While you will get a final grade at the end of the term, I will not be grading each individual assignments, but rather asking questions and making comments that engage your work rather than simply evaluate it. The intention here is to help you focus on working in a more organic way, as opposed to working as you think you’re expected to.&#x20;

If this process causes more anxiety than it alleviates, see me at any point to confer about your progress in the course to date. If you are worried about your grade, your best strategy should be to join the discussions, do the reading, and complete the assignments.
