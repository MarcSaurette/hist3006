[Mindmeister](https://www.mindmeister.com/?r=976984) is a web-based interface to allow project planning or brainstorming to happen collaboratively. It feel like it might be a good place for us to share ideas or make mindmaps to keep us on track.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Mindmeister allows you three (3) free maps in its basic (free) service. If you sign up for an account via this [link](https://www.mindmeister.com/?r=976984) it gives me an additional map I can see (which is important if you want me to see a map you create).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

I have started two planning maps that students can contribute to once you're signed up. Consider both very much _in progress_. You can see them via the links below:

1. [Outlining basic details of the Council of Sens](https://mm.tt/1726323948?t=aGnjk7G9UL) (setting, cast of characters, timing etc.)
2. [Outlining game design work flow](https://mm.tt/1717022864?t=LFzqMVspPK) (jobs, teams, areas of responsibility)&#x20;
3. [Outline of characters/factions](https://mm.tt/1816270760?t=4oRv9qFVfG)
