# Google Docs

For ease, we will write up our Game Manual using Google Documents, which will require that you have a google account, which I imagine you already have. So I won't write up instructions how to do this.&#x20;

[Here is a link to the Game Design document ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PNygAkmh9WLnt\_6tRZfrO63-QYhHAVw6CceRuJIZUlc/edit?usp=sharing)for building the Council of Sens game we will co-author. Typically, you should imagine that you write first drafts privately (in this or other word processing software) and then paste them into these documents. This link will allow you to view the template, but you must request editing privileges in order to make additions. &#x20;
