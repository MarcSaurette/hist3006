# Google Docs

For pure ease, we will write up our Game Manual using Google Documents, which will require that you have a google account.&#x20;

Here are links to the two documents we will co-author. Typically, you should imagine that you write first drafts privately (in this or other word processing software) and then paste them into these documents.&#x20;

These links will allow you to view these (currently empty) docs, so you must request editing privileges.&#x20;
