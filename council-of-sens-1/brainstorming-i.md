# Brainstorming I

### November 14th & 16th

We will start to codify our understanding of the Council of Sens into distinct episodes with corresponding debates, game mechanics and goals.&#x20;

* On Monday we will decide the time frame covered by the game, the goals and victory conditions, as well as the stages for debate
* On Wednesday, we will divide into work teams to divide up work and consider how to integrate overarching goals (decided on Monday) into different tasks for each student

### Goals

This week our key goals to achieve will be to turn the history we learned and read about in the previous week into game play elements.&#x20;

* Determine the key processes in the historical event or system
  * which processes should be simulated to gamify the council of Sens
