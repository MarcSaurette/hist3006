# Background and Overview

### November 7th & 9th

This week, we jump ahead sixty or so years after the events at Canossa, to see new developments in Church authority and the development of Christian learning. The foundations laid during the Investiture Controversy led to a long term centralization of the Latin Church around the power of the bishop of Rome – a power that increasingly was supported by a bureaucracy (_curia_) seeking to unify ideas of Christian belief. A part of this centralization and standardization of the Church was influence over new concentrations of scholars and students at the cathedral schools that would later develop into the first universities of Europe.&#x20;
