# Synod of Worms

### September 26th & 28th

The _Investiture Controversy_ game opens with a synod (gathering of bishops) and diet (irregular meeting with secular leaders) convened by [King Henry IV](https://www-oxfordreference-com.proxy.library.carleton.ca/view/10.1093/acref/9780227679319.001.0001/acref-9780227679319-e-1281?rskey=ra0G1z\&result=1) in [Worms](https://www-oxfordreference-com.proxy.library.carleton.ca/view/10.1093/acref/9780227679319.001.0001/acref-9780227679319-e-3069?rskey=Oc8iSt\&result=16).&#x20;

#### 1076 (24 Jan.)

In the aftermath of continuing conflicts between pope and king about nominating and investing bishops in their positions (including Milan), in late 1075, Gregory wrote a letter to Henry IV, demanding that the king show obedience to him, the papal office, and acknowledge papal rights over bishops. Henry IV had just put down a rebellion, and received the letter when he was newly flush with victory. Knowing that his father had installed a few popes himself and unwilling to tolerate further resistence to his rule, Henry convened his nobles and key members of the Church in German lands on the 24th of January (1076) to respond to the letter and consider its claims to supremacy over bishops (i.e. the episcopate).&#x20;

Your starting point for preparing for the debate should be reading the following letter which brings simmering tensions to a boil:

* check out the [maps](../investiture-controversy-game/maps.md) to understand the geography of the conflict
* See [Letter of Gregory to Henry](https://app.perusall.com/courses/medieval-religious-life-2022/brian-tierney-the-crisis-of-church-and-state-1050-1300-with-selected-documents-prentice-hall-inc-1964?assignmentId=FMpEFGGRusKZfRNTR\&part=1) complaining of the king's mistreatment of the church (December 1075), trans. E.Emerton, _The Correspondence of Pope Gregory VII_ (New York, 1932), pp.87-89.
* Other examples of Gregory's correspondence can be read in [Emerton's work](https://app.perusall.com/courses/medieval-religious-life-2022/records-of-civilization-ephraim-emerton-the-correspondence-of-pope-gregory-vii\_-selected-letters-from-the-registrum-columbia-university-press-1991?assignmentId=yG3qqEKTDs6LPzAuK\&part=1) (1932) which has many letters relevent to understand the characters involved in the Investiture Controversy and to the ideas underpinning the doctinal conflict between pope and king. Another translation of other letters from Gregory (1972) is also posted on Perusall.&#x20;

### Gameplay Context:

The Patarene movement in Milan has:&#x20;

* succeeded?
* failed?

### Debates:&#x20;

**September 26th Debate**: Our starting point is Henry IV (and his court's) reaction to Gregory's Letter demanding submission to papal oversight of bishops. The debate will be about _Papal supremacy over the episcopate._

* The readings for these debates are open. Students can read at will what they find most relevant. I might suggest that students read a bit about Henry III (Henry IV's father) who at the Council of Sutri (1046) deposed three vying popes (each of whom saw themselves as legitimate). While this was unprecidented at the time it did establish an idea that kings had oversight over the Church. This would give evidence for the negative side of the debate (#royalBishops)
