# Lenten Synod of Rome

### October 3rd & 5th

1076 (14‒22 Feb.)

In the weeks following the debates and actions taken at the [Synod of Worms](synod-of-worms.md), a gathering of court officials, bishops, and nobles, met under the leadership of Gregory VII to consider a response. The Lenten Synod at Rome was a regular meeting of the Roman clergy - i.e. the priests, administrative staff and major bishops linked to the (arch)diocese of Rome, typically used for mundane administrative reforms - ensuring church offices were filled, that bureaucractic needs were met and then addressing any doctrinal/ theological/customary issues that had arisen.&#x20;

Papal councils worked to emphasize the prestige of the papacy. The great celebrations held in the Lateran were above all representations of papal power and authority. And while councils were places for debate, the agenda was set by the person presiding – in this case, Pope Gregory VII.&#x20;

Gregory VII will choose the topics of debate to respond to the declarations from Worms and to argue for the power of the papacy. The goal of the debates for Gregory is to win over indeterminates to an acceptance of papal primacy (defined in different ways) and make common cause with those devoted to undermining Henry's power.&#x20;

### Gameplay Context:&#x20;

_Previous debate_: The initial thrust against the pope came from imperial bishops, who had had much of their local authority compromised by Gregory’s claims to power. Should the Pope be free of precedent, they asked? The Nay (imperial side) took it with a considerable margin, but not so much that this could not be later opened up for debate again. Did the King find support for his desire to depose Gregory VII? He eked out a close win. Henry IV and his bishops have declared (or claimed that) Pope Gregory is no longer pope.&#x20;

Henry will not attend the Synod at Rome, and thus, like Gregory at Worms, will not be able to vote.&#x20;

_Previous Actions_. No actions previously taken. &#x20;
