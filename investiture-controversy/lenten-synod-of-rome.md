# Lenten Synod of Rome

### October 3rd & 5th

1076 (14â€’22 Feb.)

In the weeks following the debates and actions taken at the [Synod of Worms](synod-of-worms.md), a gathering of court officials, bishops, and nobles, met under the leadership of Gregory VII to consider a response. The Lenten Synod at Rome was a regular meeting of the Roman clergy - i.e. the priests, administrative staff and major bishops linked to the (arch)diocese of Rome, typically used for mundane administrative reforms - ensuring church offices were filled, that bureaucractic needs were met and then addressing any doctrinal/ theological/customary issues that had arisen.&#x20;

Gregory VII will choose the topics of debate to respond to the declarations from Worms and to argue for the power of the papacy. The goal of the debates for Gregory is to win over indeterminates to an acceptance of papal primacy (defined in different ways) and make common cause with those devoted to undermining Henry's power.&#x20;
