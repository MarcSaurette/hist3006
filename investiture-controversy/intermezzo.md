# Intermezzo

### October 12th

Due to Thanksgiving, we will not have class on Monday. On Wednesday we will break out of the game and spend some time meta-gaming: talking through what has happened, and answering your questions about the medieval church, the papacy, the power of the Germans kings and anything else you might want to know in order to tackle the final rounds of gameplay.&#x20;

Topics will be suggested by students in advance. Please submit questions on Teams by October 7th, 4pm.&#x20;
