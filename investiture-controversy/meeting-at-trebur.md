# Meeting at Trebur

### October 17th & 19th

1076 (October)

Propaganda and denunciations have been swirling for months. Relatively unpressured by any regal or papal presence, characters have retired to Trebur under the leadership of Sigward of Aquileia where they can debate issues without fear of offending king or pope.

**Context**:&#x20;

* Antipope = Sigward
* Henry declared deposed and excommunicated
* Gregory declared deposed and replaced
* Otto of Constance excommunicated
* Manasses de Gourney and Altwin of Brixen guilty of simony, but their churches are strong-armed into accepting them by the Anti-pope

**Debates**:&#x20;

1. Proprietary Church System
2. Lay Investiture (relitigation)
